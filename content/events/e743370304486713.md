This is a wonderful community event! If you love donkeys, this is the place for you! Saturday is the Burro Race and St. Paddy’s Day Costume Contest, then on Sunday we have an In-hand Obstacle Course Challenge. There will be food trucks, vendors, and kids’ activities! The Race is a 3, 6, or 9 mile course! The 3 mile is a great beginner course you can walk with your donkey!! Come and join the fun! If you don’t own a donkey but want to participate, there are local rescues who have donkeys to rent! You can also just come watch and enjoy being a part of the burro community! <br>
