After all, it’s only “one climb”! 😉 <br>
  <br>
  Join us on March 22nd for the 33rd running of the Crown King Scramble 50k! <br>
  <br>
  From 'spines to pines' start lakeside on the serene shores of Lake Pleasant and run through the heart of the Sonoran Desert to climb to the cool pines of the Bradshaw Mountains.<br>
  <br>
  Stay and celebrate your victory after you cross the finish line in the historic and quaint town of Crown King! It’s a race like no other and a day you’ll never forget. <br>
  <br>
  We hope to see you at the saloon this spring!<br>
  <br>
