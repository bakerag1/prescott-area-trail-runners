We will meet at the Woodchute Trailhead up on Mingus Mtn. Out and back with variable distances possible.<br>
  <br>
  Parking location&#58; 34.71557, -112.16019<br>
  <br>
  ***Plan for extra driving time for this one!***<br>
  <br>
  Take a break from the heat and come run in the pines with epic views! This is a no-drop group run (we stop at every intersection so everyone can catch up before running again). Anticipate 7 miles for the full trail -but as this is an out and back any distance is welcome if you want to turn back earlier and do a shorter distance &#58;) <br>
  <br>
  Bring water! <br>
