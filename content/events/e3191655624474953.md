This training run will be following the northern loop of the Elephant Mountain 50 Mile, but everyone is welcome (whether you’re racing or not). The northern portion of the course within the Tonto National Forest is quite rugged. Previewing this section of the trail before race day is very valuable. <br>

  The route starts at Spur Cross Parking lot. The first 2.5 miles are quite easy as you make your way north. There are a couple spots where you cross Cave Creek and you may get your feet wet. At mile 2.5, there’s a substantial water crossing before entering the Tonto National Forest. You’ll slowly climb as you make your way north to Skunk Canyon where you’ll cross Cave Cave Creek a few more times (use this as an opportunity to cool off). This is probably the most beautiful section of the course. Lots of flowing water, green plants, and stunning views. At mile 12 you’ll hit the one and only aid station. <br>
  <br>
  For the return journey, you’ll be following some trails that aren’t really trails… more like game paths. Some parts are pretty overgrown and this entire section is very exposed. Make sure to pack enough water when you leave Seven Springs. This section is net downhill to the finish, but it doesn’t seem like it. There are a lot of punchy climbs. Make sure to follow the GPX closely. This is the exact route that I took last year when I ran the race (and never went off course). You’ll finally get back to Cave Creek and take the same trail back that you started out on. <br>
