Meeting at the trailhead off of Hwy 89&#58; 34.572236, -112.436545<br>
  <br>
  Drive up 89 away from Prescott toward Chino, turn RIGHT at the light across from Cliff Rose/Rosser St. Trailhead is right next to Hwy 89.<br>
  <br>
  No drop group run (we stop at every intersection and wait for everyone to join up before running again). This is an out and back. <br>
  <br>
  Expect 4-6 mi<br>
  <br>
  Bring a light &#58;)<br>
