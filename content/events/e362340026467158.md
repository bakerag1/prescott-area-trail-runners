Commemorative group run to the giant alligator juniper, made famous by the Granite Mtn Hotshots! The anniversary for the Granite Mtn Hotshots is 6/30 so this will be a special memorial run. <3 This is a no-drop run so we will stop at every intersection and allow everyone to catch up! Expect 5 miles total on an out and back. <br>
