It’s always a DAM good time at Dam Good Run! <br>
  <br>
  Join us Sunday, April 3rd at beautiful Lake Pleasant for the 19th annual Dam Good Run/Walk/Hike. <br>
  <br>
  There’s a distance option for everyone, and all except for the 2 mile runners get to cross the New Waddell Dam! <br>
  <br>
  Enjoy rugged single track, challenging climbs and beautiful lake vistas in the 40k, 26k, and 13k! The 4 mile and 2 mile distances utilize the newly added, Roadrunner Trail, that takes runners right along the lakeside. <br>
  <br>
  All courses are fast, fun, and finish with a straight shot into the refreshing waters of Lake Pleasant if you’re looking for an immediate cool down after your race! <br>
  <br>
  So bring your kayaks, paddle boards and picnics and make it a “racing lake day” at Dam Good Run on April 3rd!<br>
  <br>
