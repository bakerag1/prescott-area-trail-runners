Join us for the 2025 edition of Whiskey Basin Trail Runs in beautiful, Prescott, Arizona. Choose to take on the 'full barrel' point to point 91k, 60k, 33k, or the challenging and rewarding, 1/2 Marathon or 10k that all take place on the gorgeous Prescott Circle Trail. All distances finish at the party overlooking Watson Lake and those iconic Granite Dells where you'll want to kick back and stay to socialize, enjoy the view, and maybe some whiskey...hey, when in Rome, right?<br>
