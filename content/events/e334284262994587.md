Please join us for Loop The Butte, Sunday May 26th from 7am to 12 noon! This is open to everyone for FREE! So come on out and see your fellow PATR Runners loop the butte. Do as many or as few laps as you wish! There will be an aide station with all kind of snacks, drinks and such!<br>
  <br>
  This is also doubling as a charity event for The Launch Pad Teen Center in Prescott. For the past 6 years they have hosted a Trek4Teens Rim2Rim hike of the Grand Canyon. Adults, like me and possibly you, sign up and agree to raise money for TLP's Outdoor Progams. Last years hike raised $72,000. If you would like to donate, the link will be provided in the comments. As and added bonus, the first 20 people to donate at least $50 and complete 5 laps will recieve a special gift (think Goodrs, Cocodona Swag and Javelina 100 Swag). As a second added bonus, your donation is a TAX CREDIT on your AZ State taxes. Talk to your tax professional for specifics or just ask Molly or me. <br>
