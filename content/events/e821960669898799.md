Turley Trailhead&#58; [https://maps.app.goo.gl/y5vZJMo8UeM6Juis5?g_st=ic<br>

  We will start at Turley Trailhead and do one of two loop options below with a possible Badger Mountain summit if you are feeling spicy. Based on participation we can decide whether we want to do the Badger summit first for those who want less miles. <br>
  <br>
  Below is the breakdown of distances. Note that we can collectively decide what loop folks want to do or if some want to just do an out and back. Again, everything depends on attendance, pace and desired mileage. As with all of these night runs, we are leaving no one behind. But please take a look at the map or download it just in case. <br>
