Groom Creek Loop Trail #307, S Senator Hwy, Prescott, AZ 86303<br>
  <br>
  34.4762915458251, -112.44153522818031<br>
  <br>
  Out and back up and down Spruce Mtn (if a second group wants to loop the mountain that's fine too!). Expect 5-7 mi (out and back so everyone can choose their preferred distance)<br>
  <br>
  No drop group run (we stop along the way to allow everyone to catch up and then run again). <br>
  <br>
  Bring water! (consider a headlamp due to the longer distance)<br>
