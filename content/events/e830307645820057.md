More info to come. Look for a couple run distances and options. Once I get the details up, please try to respond by Tuesday June 18th so we can work out the logistics on if we need to shuttle.  <br>
  <br>
  Currently thinking about starting at the dirt lot on Willow Lake Rd and looping Willow Lake, then heading over to Watson Lake to play in the Dells. This should allow for a ton of different run lengths and options. Stay tuned in the next few days as details emerge as I bounce some ideas off folks. <br>
