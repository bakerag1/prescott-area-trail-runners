Please try to respond by Tuesday June 18th so we can work out the logistics on if we need to shuttle.  <br>

)  <br>
  There are a couple distance options and places to park or shuttle based on desired length. Attached are 3 links to each of the segments. <br>
  <br>
  We will start at the dirt lot off Willow Lake Rd and run a clockwise loop around Willow Lake (6.1 mi.) taking us back to the parking lot. For those that wish to continue, we will use the Circle Trail to run across the road to the Watson Lake Overlook (1.2 mi). From there we will do a counterclockwise Watson Lake Loop (4.7 mi) back to the overlook. Then run back along the Circle Trail back to the Willow Lake Rd dirt lot (1.2 mi). <br>
  <br>
  All runners and paces welcome. We shall see how logistics actually work, thus the request to put in availability by the 18th, so we can figure out groups and if we need to have some people shuttle from a spot on the Watson Lake Loop for your desired distance. We will ensure everyone  feels safe, no one gets lost and we have a group or groups that all know the way. With all that said, I provided the routes, so please either have them downloaded or have a general understanding of the route just in case. <br>
  <br>
  Totals<br>
  6.1 mi. Willow Lake Loop<br>
  7.3 mi. to Watson Lake Overlook <br>
  12 mi. With both loops<br>
  13.2 circuit<br>
  <br>
  Iâ€™m super pumped for this first night adventure. Bring a headlamp and a good attitude and we will have a blast. <br>
