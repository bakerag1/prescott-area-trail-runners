PLEASE READ THIS DESCRIPTION. <br>
  <br>
  We will meet at the White Spar Parking lot (link here [https://goo.gl/maps/nX4JGH75u4T7R15g7](https://goo.gl/maps/nX4JGH75u4T7R15g7)) at 5&#58;30 PM. Expect 4-6 miles. No drop run (we stop for everyone at every intersection). <br>
  <br>
  Be careful, this is NOT the usual white ROCK parking lot, this is white SPAR. <br>
  <br>
  Bring a headlamp!<br>
