No drop group run (we stop at every intersection and wait for everyone to join together again). Expect 5ish miles. Bring a light &#58;)<br>

  This trail is an out and back and great for running in the dark because the lights of the city look beautiful on the way back - and it's a full sun trail so nice to run it in cooler temps! <br>
  <br>
  We will park along Walker Road instead of parking in the parking lot for the trail (the trail will close while we are out running and we don't want our cars locked in - but there are several areas to park along Walker Rd. near the trailhead entrance).<br>
