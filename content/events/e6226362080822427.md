No drop group run - we stop at every intersection and wait for everyone to catch up before running again. <br>
  <br>
  This loop is a bit of a drive but its one of the best in the area! From rocks and desert to pines and forest -this loop has it all! The first two miles involve a lot of elevation gain (expect 1000 ft) followed by two miles of rolling hills and 2 miles of downhill with an epic view! If you survive the first two miles you will agree its all worth it by the end &#58;) <br>
  <br>
  Bring water!! That hill is full sun.<br>
  <br>
  Directions&#58; Drive up Hwy 89 headed away from PV toward Jerome -look for the trailhead off to the right on the side of the road - before you get to the curvy part. <br>
