Ready to be hypnotized? <br>
  <br>
  Well then, plan to join us on June 22nd for the third race in our Insomniac Night Runs Series, Hypnosis Night Runs! <br>
  <br>
  NEW COURSE!!! What? <br>
  <br>
  Thatâ€™s right, we are once again using the same new, fun course from the 2021 edition! <br>
  <br>
  All runs will be staged out of the main park, at the Coldwater Trailhead. We're excited to introduce this new route, highlighting some of the great trails of Estrella Mountain Park. Experience Butterfield, Gadsen, Coldwater, Dysart, and Rainbow Valley trails depending on your distance. These new routes are flowy and fun! <br>
  <br>
  So pick your poison (50k, 36k, 22k, 15k or 6k) Insomniacs, and plan to party the night away on the trails at Hypnosis Night Runs!<br>
  <br>
