It’s the original costumed ultra trail run party in the desert…<br>
  <br>
  It’s the world famous, Javelina Jundred presented by Hoka! <br>

  The race is held on a 20 mile rolling single track trail course comprised mostly of the Pemberton Trail in beautiful McDowell Mountain Regional Park near Fountain Hills, Arizona. Runners will take on 100 miles, 100k or a nighttime 31k dubbed “Jackass Night Trail” on a looped course in the gorgeous Sonoran Desert. <br>

  Come dressed in your best and be ready to party at the one and only, Javelina Jundred!<br>
