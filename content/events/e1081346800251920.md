  Super pumped for this run. Two options available if we have 2 groups. And possible add ons for those that want just a bit more nasty. <br>
  <br>
  We will head out from Metate and summit Granite Mountain. When we get back to the split, you can choose to head back to the trailhead or continue to complete the Little Granite Mountain Loop. If people desire more distance we can make other loops from the trailhead, but a water fill up is probably necessary at that point anyway. <br>

  As with all of these runs, no one is left behind and everyone is welcome. These routes are spicy and footing can be goofy in areas so make sure you are up for the challenge if you commit. And have some knowledge of the route. Bring a headlamp, enough fluids/nutrition and your party face. This is gonna be fun one. <br>
