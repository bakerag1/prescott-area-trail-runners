PLEASE READ THIS DESCRIPTION. <br>
  <br>
  We will meet at the Peavine Trailhead by the Humane Society off of Sundog Ranch Road at 5&#58;30pm. No drop run (we stop for everyone at every intersection). <br>
  <br>
  Jim is leading! Message from Jim&#58; We just opened the first segment of the Glassford Hills Trail, about a mile out from the Peavine parking lot. The trail goes up about a mile to a spectacular view of Watson Lake and then we will come back down the Captains trail. <br>
  <br>
  Expect 4-6 miles.<br>
  <br>
  Bring water &#58;)<br>
  <br>
  ***Note&#58; This is NOT Glassford Hills Trail in PV - this is a NEW trail off of the Peavine area *** <br>
