Camp, stay, run and play! <br>
  <br>
  Welcome to the 9th annual Big Pine Trail Runs at Fort Tuthill County Park! <br>
  Runners will get to experience both the Soldiers Trail and Highlands Trail Loop (6 Km runners will only run on a partial Soldiers Trail loop) which winds through the ponderosa pines above 7,000 ft, eventually topping out on a mesa with expansive views of mountain landscapes before being enveloped back into the trees. <br>
  With so much happening in Flagstaff this weekend including Blackout Night Runs the night before and Big Woody Rides on Sunday, the Big Pine weekend is THE best way to kick off your summer. <br>
  Bring the family and we hope to see you there! <br>
