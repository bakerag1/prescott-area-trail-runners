Experience the history and beauty of the Wild West the way it was intended...on two feet! <br>
  Join us for the 2025 edition of the Black Canyon Ultras! <br>
  Enjoy winding Sonoran Desert trails in the shadow of the Bradshaw Mountains. The course is point-to-point with net elevation loss.. but do not be fooled&#58; this is a tough and taxing course with the majority of elevation gain coming the second half of the race. <br>
  Both the 100k and 50k run along the non-motorized Black Canyon Trail (a National Recreation Trail) featuring a mixture of single track trail, jeep roads, and pieces of an old stagecoach route.<br>
  Challenge yourself in 2025 and join us for the 12th annual Black Canyon Ultras. The 100k takes place on Saturday and the 50k on Sunday, giving you the unique opportunity to up the ante of epicness and run them both, making it the ‚ÄúBlack Canyon Echo Challenge‚Äù! <br>
  It‚Äôs a journey you will never forget, and we hope you‚Äôll get wild in the Wild West with us at the Black Canyon Ultras! ü§†<br>
