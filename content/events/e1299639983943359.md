Hoppiness abounds at the Jackrabbit Jubilee! <br>
  <br>
  The 12 & 6 Hour fixed-time night race kicks off this August on the 500 meter USATF certified course (road) at Nardini Manor. The course is a flat crushed gravel loop that winds its way around the grounds. Run, hop, skip, laugh and spend the night with us at Nardini Manor--fun for everybunny!<br>
