We will meet at the Metate trailhead and head up the mountain for an out and back. Those who want to go all the way to the top can, those who want to stop at the saddle can - choose the distance that is right for you <3 <br>
  <br>
  Bring water - it's hot!!! <br>
  <br>
  This is a no-drop group run, we will stop at each intersection so everyone can catch up and then run again. <br>
  <br>
  We host this run in the summer when it light late enough for a longer run in the evening and the parking lot is open late!<br>
