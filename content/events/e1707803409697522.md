This is one Jangover you won’t want a cure for...<br>
  <br>
  Yes! It’s Jangover Night Runs and it’s happening on September 21st! <br>
  <br>
  What started as an informal training run for the Javelina Jundred has evolved into one of our flagship races in the Insomniac Night Trail Run Series. Come experience the beauty of desert trail running at night under a blanket of stars! The Javelina Jangover Night Runs is the 6th and final race in the Summer Insomniac Night Trail Run Series. <br>
  <br>
  Take to the trails all night to complete 7 kilometers, 15 kilometers, 25 kilometers,50 kilometers, or 75 kilometers of trails...there’s a Jangover for every level and age of runner! <br>
  <br>
  Join us for Jangover, or snag a series pass and save big on registration. <br>
  The choice is yours! <br>
  <br>
  We “jope” to see you this September at Jangover Night Runs at McDowell Mountain Regional Park!<br>
