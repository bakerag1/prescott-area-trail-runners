  Watson Lake loop with an add on is 5ish miles before back to the car to shed and layer and eat treats before a 7.5ish mile jaunt around Willow and back.  <br>
  <br>
  And if you just want to partake in the Watson Loop, then call it quits, awesome. That works too. <br>

  I invited the Hells Dells runners to join if they choose, so there could be some new faces. This is a typical PATR low key Saturday run and wanted to give the runners of the race an option to get more familiar with the twists, turns, and white dots in the Dells in a less lost and frustrated environment. <br>
