  15 mile loop, with 1500' gain. T  here will likely be various pace  s being run. Fairly easy trail t  o follow, not many intersecting   trails. If you want to carpool,   Maverick gas station on 69 @ 89   is a good spot to meet - post in   comments if interested.\n\nhttp  s://www.facebook.com/events/1365  914951063967/
