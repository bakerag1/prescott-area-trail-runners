We are going to check out a newly built trail! This trail goes around Eagle Peak in the dells. Jim assisted with building the new trail and is going to guide the group run on this trail for the first time (Thank you Jim!).<br>
  <br>
  Expect 5.7 miles from the parking lot on 89a, past the Boblett Gravesite, and up around the peak. Miles 1-2 are kind of tough up the hill, but otherwise it's nice rolling hills through some open space and some rocks and canyons. <br>
  <br>
  Here's where we can park (Free) on old hwy 89a&#58; <br>
  34째36'48.4"N 112째25'02.8"W<br>
  (This is where we parked to run to the Boblett Gravesite this summer.)<br>
  <br>
  This is a no-drop group run so we will stop at every intersection and allow everyone to catch up before continuing on. <br>
  <br>
  Bring a light &#58;) <br>
