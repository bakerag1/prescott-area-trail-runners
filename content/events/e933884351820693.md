PLEASE READ THIS DESCRIPTION. <br>
  <br>
  This is a trail we haven't ever done for a Tuesday run! <br>
  <br>
  We will meet here&#58; [https://maps.app.goo.gl/nLr37AZ9G12KU2ta9?g_st=ic](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nLr37AZ9G12KU2ta9?g_st=ic) at 5&#58;30pm. No drop run (we stop for everyone at every intersection). <br>
  <br>
  Jim is leading! (Thank you Jim!) Gateway trail to Elizabeth trail to Boblett trail past the grave site. <br>
  <br>
  Expect 4-6 miles.<br>
  <br>
  Bring water &#58;) No really, it's getting hot - bring water!<br>
