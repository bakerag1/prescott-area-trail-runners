No drop group run (we stop at every intersection and join up before running again). <br>
  <br>
  Bring a headlamp.<br>
  <br>
  Expect 5ish miles. (no waterfalls guaranteed- this is an AZ waterfall after all!) <br>
  <br>
  Drive up Hwy 89, turn right on E Granite Dells Rd, trailhead on the right. <br>
