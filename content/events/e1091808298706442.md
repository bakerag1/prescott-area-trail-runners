  ***This trailhead can be confusing to find and GPS is sometimes wrong!! Follow the route below from FS!***<br>
  <br>
  Directions from FS&#58;<br>
  From downtown Prescott, travel east on Hwy 69 to Walker Road. Turn right and go 1.2 miles to the sign for Lynx Creek Ruin. Turn left onto Lynx Creek Road (FR 9401) just after the sign. Travel 0.8 miles past the Day Use area, bearing right down the hill and continuing to the end of the road. There is a large improved lot with ample parking for both single vehicles and horse trailers. Road conditions are paved, then graded dirt and suitable for all vehicles.<br>
