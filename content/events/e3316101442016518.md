I am going to be doing workouts on the track every Monday for the month of June.  If you are interested in running on the track for some speed work or just some flat miles, I will be there. The best way to get on the track is to park in the back where students usually park and go in the back of the school to the track. Then there are no gates that will be locked. If you have any questions message me. <br>
