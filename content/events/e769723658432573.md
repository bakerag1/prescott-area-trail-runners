We are planning to do the Constellation Trail and then a second loop to make it around 5 mi total. <br>
  <br>
  This is a no drop group run and we will stop at every intersection for everyone to catch up. No trail runner left behind! (usually - hasn't happened yet but there's a first for everything I suppose)<br>
  <br>
  Weather is unpredictable - dress for anything! -mud, snow, sun, water crossings LOL<br>
  <br>
  Bring a headlamp and water &#58;) <br>
  <br>
  Parking off Hwy 89, across from Phippen Museum in the paved trailhead parking area. <br>
