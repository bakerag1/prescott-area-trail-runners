PLEASE READ THIS DESCRIPTION. <br>
  <br>
  For this week we will run the side trails around Willow Lake. There are a lot of side trails through that most people never run. Jim mapped out about 5.2 miles from the dog park. It is through some trees and very close to the lake. We will cover 3 sides of Willow Lake on mostly flat trails.  <br>
  <br>
  This is a no-drop group run and we will stop at every intersection and allow everyone to catch up before we continue running - all paces welcome &#58;)<br>
  <br>
  We will meet at the trailhead by the dog park off of Willow Creek Rd.<br>
