                        No drop group run - we stop at every intersection and wait for everyone to catch up before running again. <br>
  <br>
  This loop is a bit of a drive but its one of the best in the area! From rocks and desert to pines and forest -this loop has it all! The first two miles involve a lot of elevation gain (expect 1000 ft) followed by two miles of rolling hills and 2 miles of downhill with an epic view! If you survive the first two miles you will agree its all worth it by the end &#58;) <br>
  <br>
  Bring water!! That hill is full sun.<br>
  <br>
  Directions&#58; Drive up Hwy 89 headed away from PV toward Jerome -look for the trailhead off to the right on the side of the road - before you get to the curvy part. <br>

                        It’s out there…will YOU be the one to find it this September 7th? <br>
  <br>
  Challenge yourself at one of the toughest and most beautiful races you’ll ever toe the line at. <br>
  <br>
  Join us this fall at the 2024 edition of the Mogollon Monster! <br>
  <br>
  Choose from the point to point 100 mile or get a hefty dose of the Monster in the 42k “Monster Marathon”. No matter which distance you choose, you are sure to appreciate breathtaking climbs up the Rim, exhilarating descents down, spectacular views in between, and possible monster sightings at each turn. <br>
  <br>
  The 42 Km course takes place on Sunday starting at the Pine Trailhead and heads out on the historic Highline Trail to its first rim climb, the Donahue Trail, where runners will join courses with the 100 milers who start 24 hours and 85 miles earlier. The drop off the rim and right back up via West Webber and Turkey Springs will test runners but be sure to soak up the views along the Mogollon Rim. Finishing with a massive vista off the Pine Canyon Trail and miles of gorgeous trail all the way back to the town of Pine where runners will cross under the finish line at the town community center. <br>
  <br>
  This is mountain running at its finest, and you’ll relish every minute of it. <br>
  <br>
  Join us in Pine this September 7-8 for the Mogollon Monster!<br>

                        After all, it’s only “one climb”! 😉 <br>
  <br>
  Join us on March 22nd for the 33rd running of the Crown King Scramble 50k! <br>
  <br>
  From 'spines to pines' start lakeside on the serene shores of Lake Pleasant and run through the heart of the Sonoran Desert to climb to the cool pines of the Bradshaw Mountains.<br>
  <br>
  Stay and celebrate your victory after you cross the finish line in the historic and quaint town of Crown King! It’s a race like no other and a day you’ll never forget. <br>
  <br>
  We hope to see you at the saloon this spring!<br>
