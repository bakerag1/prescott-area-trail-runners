  Directions&#58;  Take HWY-69 towards Prescott. After leaving the Prescott Valley area, you'll reach the intersection of HWY-69 and HWY-89. Stay left on Gurley street and make a quick left turn onto Robinson Drive into a residential area. From Robinson Drive, turn left on Butterfield Road. When you reach a five way intersection, turn right onto Wells Fargo Road. When Wells Fargo road turns north, look on your right for a small, hidden dirt road (the trailhead sign is tough to spot). Take this well graded dirt road to the parking area and Turley Trailhead.<br>

  Join us for the 2025 edition of the Black Canyon Ultras! <br>

  Challenge yourself in 2025 and join us for the 12th annual Black Canyon Ultras. The 100k takes place on Saturday and the 50k on Sunday, giving you the unique opportunity to up the ante of epicness and run them both, making it the “Black Canyon Echo Challenge”! <br>
  It’s a journey you will never forget, and we hope you’ll get wild in the Wild West with us at the Black Canyon Ultras! 🤠<br>
