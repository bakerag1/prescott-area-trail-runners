                        We are planning to do the Constellation Trail and then a second loop to make it around 5 mi total. <br>
  <br>
  This is a no drop group run and we will stop at every intersection for everyone to catch up. No trail runner left behind! (usually - hasn't happened yet but there's a first for everything I suppose)<br>
  <br>
  Weather is unpredictable - dress for anything! -mud, snow, sun, water crossings LOL<br>
  <br>
  Bring a headlamp and water &#58;) <br>
  <br>
  Parking off Hwy 89, across from Phippen Museum in the paved trailhead parking area. <br>

                        It’s always a DAM good time at Dam Good Run! <br>
  <br>
  Join us Sunday, April 3rd at beautiful Lake Pleasant for the 19th annual Dam Good Run/Walk/Hike. <br>
  <br>
  There’s a distance option for everyone, and all except for the 2 mile runners get to cross the New Waddell Dam! <br>
  <br>
  Enjoy rugged single track, challenging climbs and beautiful lake vistas in the 40k, 26k, and 13k! The 4 mile and 2 mile distances utilize the newly added, Roadrunner Trail, that takes runners right along the lakeside. <br>
  <br>
  All courses are fast, fun, and finish with a straight shot into the refreshing waters of Lake Pleasant if you’re looking for an immediate cool down after your race! <br>
  <br>
  So bring your kayaks, paddle boards and picnics and make it a “racing lake day” at Dam Good Run on April 3rd!<br>

  <br>
  🏜️ The original epic of the Cocodona name starts at Rock Springs Cafe in Black Canyon City and traverses a continuous 250 mile point-to-point route, ending in Flagstaff, Arizona. Arguably the most diverse 200+miler on the map. Be prepared for a life changing epic adventure.<br>

  <br>
  🌲 Elden Crest 38 - May 10-11, 2024<br>

  Welcome to the 9th annual Big Pine Trail Runs at Fort Tuthill County Park! <br>
  Runners will get to experience both the Soldiers Trail and Highlands Trail Loop (6 Km runners will only run on a partial Soldiers Trail loop) which winds through the ponderosa pines above 7,000 ft, eventually topping out on a mesa with expansive views of mountain landscapes before being enveloped back into the trees. <br>
  With so much happening in Flagstaff this weekend including Blackout Night Runs the night before and Big Woody Rides on Sunday, the Big Pine weekend is THE best way to kick off your summer. <br>
  Bring the family and we hope to see you there! <br>

  <br>
  Challenge yourself at one of the toughest and most beautiful races you’ll ever toe the line at. <br>
  <br>
  Join us this fall at the 2024 edition of the Mogollon Monster! <br>
  <br>
  Choose from the point to point 100 mile or get a hefty dose of the Monster in the 42k “Monster Marathon”. No matter which distance you choose, you are sure to appreciate breathtaking climbs up the Rim, exhilarating descents down, spectacular views in between, and possible monster sightings at each turn. <br>
  <br>
  The 42 Km course takes place on Sunday starting at the Pine Trailhead and heads out on the historic Highline Trail to its first rim climb, the Donahue Trail, where runners will join courses with the 100 milers who start 24 hours and 85 miles earlier. The drop off the rim and right back up via West Webber and Turkey Springs will test runners but be sure to soak up the views along the Mogollon Rim. Finishing with a massive vista off the Pine Canyon Trail and miles of gorgeous trail all the way back to the town of Pine where runners will cross under the finish line at the town community center. <br>
  <br>
  This is mountain running at its finest, and you’ll relish every minute of it. <br>
