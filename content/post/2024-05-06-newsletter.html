  This is also doubling as a charity event for The Launch Pad Teen Center in Prescott. For the past 6 years they have hosted a Trek4Teens Rim2Rim hike of the Grand Canyon. Adults, like me and possibly you, sign up and agree to raise money for TLP's Outdoor Progams. Last years hike raised $72,000. If you would like to donate, the link will be provided in the comments. As and added bonus, the first 20 people to donate at least $50 and complete 5 laps will recieve a special gift (think Goodrs, Cocodona Swag and Javelina 100 Swag). As a second added bonus, your donation is a TAX CREDIT on your AZ State taxes. Talk to your tax professional for specifics or just ask Molly or me. <br>

  <br>
  Welcome to the 9th annual Big Pine Trail Runs at Fort Tuthill County Park! <br>
  Runners will get to experience both the Soldiers Trail and Highlands Trail Loop (6 Km runners will only run on a partial Soldiers Trail loop) which winds through the ponderosa pines above 7,000 ft, eventually topping out on a mesa with expansive views of mountain landscapes before being enveloped back into the trees. <br>
  With so much happening in Flagstaff this weekend including Blackout Night Runs the night before and Big Woody Rides on Sunday, the Big Pine weekend is THE best way to kick off your summer. <br>
  Bring the family and we hope to see you there! <br>
