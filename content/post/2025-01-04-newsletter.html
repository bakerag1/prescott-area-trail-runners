  <br>
  This trail is an out and back and great for running in the dark because the lights of the city look beautiful on the way back - and it's a full sun trail so nice to run it in cooler temps! <br>
  <br>
  We will park along Walker Road instead of parking in the parking lot for the trail (the trail will close while we are out running and we don't want our cars locked in - but there are several areas to park along Walker Rd. near the trailhead entrance).<br>

  Join us for the 2025 edition of the Black Canyon Ultras! <br>
  Enjoy winding Sonoran Desert trails in the shadow of the Bradshaw Mountains. The course is point-to-point with net elevation loss.. but do not be fooled&#58; this is a tough and taxing course with the majority of elevation gain coming the second half of the race. <br>
  Both the 100k and 50k run along the non-motorized Black Canyon Trail (a National Recreation Trail) featuring a mixture of single track trail, jeep roads, and pieces of an old stagecoach route.<br>
  Challenge yourself in 2025 and join us for the 12th annual Black Canyon Ultras. The 100k takes place on Saturday and the 50k on Sunday, giving you the unique opportunity to up the ante of epicness and run them both, making it the “Black Canyon Echo Challenge”! <br>
  It’s a journey you will never forget, and we hope you’ll get wild in the Wild West with us at the Black Canyon Ultras! 🤠<br>
