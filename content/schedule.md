*Tuesdays:* 5:30 pm we have a group run at a trail in the area, usually within a
20 minute drive of downtown Prescott. 
A 4-6 mile no-drop run, which means we stop at every intersection and wait for everyone.

*Thursdays:* 5:30pm at La Planchada, Social Run run or walk your own pace and distance, grab some tacos and beverages after. We pause it during the winter, usually November-March. 

*Saturdays:* 7:30am SATR PATR no-drop trail run, at various locations, usually around 8 miles.
