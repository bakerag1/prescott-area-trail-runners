It's that time of year! Mark and I are excited about our annual event. Looks like this is our 10th year!!!!<br>
  <br>
  Join us with your family and friends for our annual Thanksgiving Fun Run. This is a great way to kick off the day. You can run, walk, or hike any distance. We will be there at 7&#58;30 with water, coffee, cocoa and mimosas. Bring a snack to share after your run. <br>
  If you like please bring non-perishable food items for the Food Bank or a Toy for the Santa toy giveaway. <br>
  Everyone is welcome 1, 2, 6, 10 miles....does not matter! It's all about fun.<br>
  Meet at the Peavine Trailhead by the Humane Society. Hope to see you there!<br>
