description: Starting at the upper parking lot of Pioneer Park (1/2 mile east of the intersection of Pioneer Parkway and Williamson Valley). The parking area is also known as the scenic overlook at the Jan Alfano Trail. If you are coming towards Williamson Valley you will need to make a u-turn at Wlliamson Valley to go east on Pioneer Parkway. We will run down Longview into Pioneer Park for 5 to 6 miles(ish). No drop and bring a headlamp. Questions call/text Noel at (928) 710-4096. <br>
