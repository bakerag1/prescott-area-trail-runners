description: PLEASE READ THIS DESCRIPTION. <br>
  <br>
  Bring a headlamp! <br>
  We will meet at the Cattleguard intersection (link here https&#58;//goo.gl/maps/CnyTC6ToppAjWTcn6) at 5&#58;30pm. <br>
  <br>
  Be prepared for interesting weather. This location is typically OK for rain as the inner basin trails are decomposed granite.<br>
  <br>
  Expect 5-6 miles, all downhill (except for the uphills). No drop run (we stop for everyone at every intersection). <br>
