description: PLEASE READ THIS DESCRIPTION. <br>
  We will meet at Upper Parking lot along Iron Springs, where the circle trail crosses the Iron Springs at 5&#58;30pm. Expect 5 miles. No drop run (we stop for everyone at every intersection). <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  We will run again as a group with some important rules&#58; <br>
  - Do NOT attend the group runs if you are not feeling well.<br>
  - Each runner will be spaced at least 10 feet while we run,<br>
  - Maintain a 6-foot distance between runners when we stop at trail intersections,<br>
  - No snot-rockets or spitting. If you have to do that, step to the side of the trail and wait for everyone to go by. <br>
  - If the group is larger than 10 people, we will evenly divide into 2 groups of no more than 10. If more than 20 people show up, we will evenly divide into 3 groups of no more than 10. <br>
  - If you do not feel comfortable running with others, you can run on your own. <br>
  - Group photos will adhere to social distancing practices.<br>
  <br>
  As always, these runs give us respite from our partisan world - let's make this a run about running. <br>
