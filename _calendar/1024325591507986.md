description: Great opportunity for volunteers and runners to preview some of the Cocodona 250 Course. Friendly Pines Camp has graciously allowed us to park at the camp for the start of our run and we will follow the course through Prescott and out to Prescott Valley to the approximate location of the Iron King Aid Station. You can join us for all or part of the adventure. The approximate distance from Friendly Pines to Whiskey Row is 9 miles and then another 13 miles to Prescott Valley via the Iron King spur of the Peavine. We will work on a vehicle shuttle as we figure out who is participating. Call or text me at (928) 710-4096 with questions. We will plan to meet for food/drinks afterwards at a local watering hole. <br>
