starting at: 2023-06-20 17:30<br>until: 2023-06-20 20:30<br><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1300428840897978/">more info on FB</a><br><br>Sunset at Yeagar!<br>
  <br>
  Meeting at 530. No drop run! (We stop at every intersection and wait for the whole group to catch up before running again - no runners left behind!) <br>
  <br>
  Expect 1000 ft of elevation gain in the first two miles (yes some people hike this part!) followed by 2 miles with rolling hills and flat(ish) trails thru a forested canyon to a sunset lookout and ending with the most amazing downhill in all of the area - gorgeous views the whole way - beautiful trail (ok ok maybe this is one of my favorite trails!!)<br>

  Note&#58; This run is a little further out so you may need to plan for additional drive time. <br>
