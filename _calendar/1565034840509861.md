description: Jasmine and Jason are hosting a group no-drop run on the ~6 mile Yeagar Canyon Loop with 1500 ft elevation gain. The parking area is right along 89A and be prompt! The group will be leaving exactly at 4&#58;30 so they will be able to catch the sunset from the trail. Don't forget your headlamp for the last couple of dark miles. <br>
