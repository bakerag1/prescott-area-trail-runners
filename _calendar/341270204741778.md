description: PATR PRTY!  🎉 How many times can you loop the butte? Come find out! Up the steep down the long. It’s only a 2 mile loop and you have a chance to win a National Parks Pass and more! So come on out and do as many loops as you can or as few as you want. 😊 <br>
  <br>
  Trying to raise $$$ for The Launch Pad Teen Center’s annual Trek 4 Teens R2R held on the first weekend of October. Your $$ can help get teens out into the great outdoors! We’ll post more details in a few days, but save the date and come on out and loop the butte!<br>

  Drinks, snacks and shade to be provided by Jeff & Molly Auman<br>
