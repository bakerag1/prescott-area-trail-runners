  <br>
  Bring a headlamp! <br>
  We will meet at the Metate trailhead (this is different than our normal meetingup) (link here https&#58;//goo.gl/maps/nFGPkJvNWUvCv7us6) at 5&#58;30pm. <br>
  <br>
  Expect 5-6 miles, all downhill (except for the uphills). No drop run (we stop for everyone at every intersection). <br>
