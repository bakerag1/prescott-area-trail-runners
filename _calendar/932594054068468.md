  We will meet at White Rock Parking lot (link here https&#58;//goo.gl/maps/YN2uMvQnyQWTM9JK7) at 5&#58;30pm. <br>
  <br>
  There will be 2 groups of runners - beginner (3 miles) and intermediate+ (5-6 miles). Both groups are no-drop which means we stop at every intersection and wait for everyone. <br>
