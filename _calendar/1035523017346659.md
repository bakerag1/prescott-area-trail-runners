description: We will meet at the Seven Mile Gulch Trailhead parking area just off of Walker Rd. at 5&#58;30pm. No drop run (we stop for everyone at every intersection). The intermediate+ group will be running 5-6 miles. The beginners group will start at the same place and time and we welcome everyone. Feel free to text or call Noel at (928) 710-4096 if you have questions or need directions.<br>
