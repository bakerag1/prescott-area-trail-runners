description: Out and back on the Circle Trail from Sundog Ranch Road. Bring a headlamp in case we get caught in the dark at the end of our run. This will be mostly uphill for the first half and then back downhill to our cars. This is not a designated trailhead so park along the street. Call/text Noel at (928) 710-4096 with questions.  <br>
