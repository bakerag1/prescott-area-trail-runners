starting at: 2023-11-25 09:00<br>until: 2023-11-25 13:00<br><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1008397293720574/">more info on FB</a><br><br>EVERYONE is invited to a Socail Run on Saturday, November 25th @ 9&#58;00am @ White Rock Trailhead Parking Lot! There will be a  3-4 mile hike, 4-6 mile run and a longer run than that, hopefully led by a few of the 2024 Cocodona Runners with a Charity Bib. Stephanie Rosebaugh, Harley Guy & Thomas Arnold are scheduled to attend! Im pretty sure that a couple of past runners will be in attendance as well. Come on out and be a Coco Crazy like me. After the runs there will be a PIZZA PARTY with soda, dessert & music provided. There will also be a table set up for your used gear that you once loved and now no longer need and feel good about giving away. Any leftover gear will be donated to a local charity.<br>
  ATTENTION! There will also be an opportunity to donate to Stephanie, Thomas & Harley to support their charities for Cocodona. As always, there is absolutely NO pressure to contribute! Donate if you feel so inclined to do so. <br>
  <br>
  Thanks everyone! Please let  us know if you plan to attend so that we can have enough pizza for everyone! Hope to see you there!<br>
  If you are interested in lending a hand, message me. TIA<br>
