The run will summit three of the highest peaks in the bradshaws. We will start at white spar campground and take trails/double track up to the mount Tritle summit, then will make our way to the summit of Mount Union before dropping down to potato patch and taking the Isabella trail up to the Spruce summit. We will then bomb down spruce and schoolhouse gulch trail 67 back to white spar.<br>
  <br>
  We will start at 8pm and run into the night so bring lights. Everyone welcome, but know that This will be a highly technical and challenging run. 30+ miles and 5,000-6,000 feet of climbing in the dark.<br>
  <br>
  I will post the gpx route as the run gets closer.<br>

  Aid (water, light snacks) will be available at a few spots along the way but prepare to carry most of your own stuff.<br>
