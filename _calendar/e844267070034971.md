It’s almost time to ring in 2023 and the only place to be this New Year’s Eve is on Whiskey Row in downtown Prescott! We’re proud to have our presenting sponsors, Desert Financial Credit Union and Experience Prescott Office of Tourism, support this year’s 12th annual Boot Drop! <br>
  <br>
  There will be two drops - 10pm and midnight, when a six-foot illuminated cowboy boot is lowered from the Palace building’s flagpole. Co-sponsored by Prescott Outpatient Surgery Center. <br>
  <br>
  This is a FREE event right on Whiskey Row in downtown Prescott. Live music with the group The Pickup Lines Band, so you dance the night away right on the street! There will food vendors, giveaways, carnival, and just plain fun! So let's give 2022 the BOOT and ring in 2023 together!<br>
