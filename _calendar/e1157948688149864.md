Come celebrate the first (of hopefully many) PATR trail run from Woods Edge.  We will provide coffee, orange juice, tea and assorted breakfast items (bagels, pastries, fresh fruit, etc).  Mimosas will be available as well.  I will provide some suggested routes from 3 to 10 miles.  Or run your favorite route in Spence Basin.  The festivities will continue into the early afternoon (say 3pm or so), and all are welcome to hang out and socialize.  <br>
  <br>
  In the afternoon we'll have the grill fired up and we'll have hamburgers and hot dogs available - or bring your own favorite item for grilling.  So you can run long, or short, then join us for food and backyard fun.  This event will be held rain or shine (or even snow!), but we will move indoors in the event of adverse weather.<br>
