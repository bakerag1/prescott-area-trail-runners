description: PLEASE READ THIS DESCRIPTION. <br>
  We will meet at the Peavine Trailhead by the Humane Society at 5&#58;30pm. No drop run (we stop for everyone at every intersection). The intermediate + group will be previewing the Whiskey Basin 10K course, Since the group is starting at the Peavine Trailhead instead of the official race start at the gazebo,  the total distance will be ~6.5 miles. There will also be a beginners group starting at the same place and time and we welcome everyone. <br>
