Weekly group run for all Prescott runners! We will meet at the Soul Ride bike shop located on Montezuma every Thursday at 5&#58;30pm.<br>
  <br>
  Who is this for?<br>
  Everyone! Runners of all paces and experience should join. There are many reasons to join&#58;<br>
  - Meet other runners in the area<br>
  - Find people who run at your pace and have similar goals<br>
  - Get motivation and inspiration to stay healthy<br>
  - Get tips on how to move to the next distance or speed<br>
  - Have fun!<br>
  <br>
  How long are the runs?<br>
  The short answer is&#58; as long as you want. We will suggest safe routes around the shop but you are welcome to create your own. The urban trail is very close and a very good place to run. We encourage everyone to stay for a bit after the run and socialize with others. Water will be available behind Soul Ride, as well as a comfortable place to hang out.<br>
