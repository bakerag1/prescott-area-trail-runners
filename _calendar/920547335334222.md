description: Approximately a 6 mile loop starting at the Salida Gulch Trailhead and then counterclockwise via Salida Gulch Trail #95 (checking out some petroglyphs along the trail), then join Johns Tank Trail #94 to Lynx Lake, and then along Lynx Creek back to our vehicles. Those PATR peeps that don't want to run the entire 6 miles can choose to run just the Salida Gulch loop for 4.3 miles. Don't forget your headlamps!<br>
