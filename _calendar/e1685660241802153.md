description: PLEASE READ THIS DESCRIPTION. <br>
  We will meet at the White Spar Parking lot (link here https&#58;//goo.gl/maps/nX4JGH75u4T7R15g7) at 5&#58;30pm. <br>
  <br>
  Warning. The non-beginner's route will be a bit tougher than usual. Around 5.5 miles, with 3-4 steep uphills on rocky terrain. The views are worth it but it will take about 1200 feet of combined climbing to get there. Please be prepared and consider the beginner's group if you're not comfortable with this type of run. <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Beginner group can expect 4 miles and the intermediate + group can expect 6 miles. No drop run (we stop for everyone at every intersection).<br>
  <br>
  Be careful, this is NOT the usual white ROCK parking lot, this is white SPAR. <br>
