PLEASE READ THIS DESCRIPTION. <br>
  We will meet at the White Spar Parking lot (link here [https://goo.gl/maps/nX4JGH75u4T7R15g7](https://goo.gl/maps/nX4JGH75u4T7R15g7)) at 5&#58;30pm. Beginner group can expect 4 miles and the intermediate + group can expect 6 miles. No drop run (we stop for everyone at every intersection).<br>
