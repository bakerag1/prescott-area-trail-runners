The plan is to summit Granite Mtn (~8mi), then drive to and summit Thumb Butte (~2mi), then drive to and summit Spruce Mtn (~8mi). Join for ANY or all of them! If you do them all in one day, you've completed the Prescott Triple Crown Challenge, which was created by our own Clint Rusing and PJ Fisher.<br>
  <br>
  Meet up in Metate lot at 7&#58;15am. Pay $5 CASH for parking OR use your National Parks Pass. (carpool opportunity if you meet up outside of the park - plan this individually).<br>
  <br>
  If you want to join up sometime after Granite, comment here or use messenger and we can let you know our approx arrival time to those trailheads. It will likely take about 8 hours to complete the whole challenge.<br>
