description: Come for a bite and a drink! A few friends from the San Tan Trail Runners (southeast valley) will be up for the weekend, camping in my yard and running/hiking/bonding. Figured it would be a perfect time to invite everyone over for a potluck/bbq. <br>
  <br>
  Bring whatever food/drink you'd like. If imbibing, feel free to pitch a tent, hammock, pad/sleeping bag - anything you'd like in order to crash in the great outdoors! &#58;-) That will give you the perfect opportunity to partake in the Sunday morning bagel bash! <br>
  <br>
  Some of us plan to do the Prescott Triple Crown on Saturday; I'll post details if you'd like to join! Other hike/run options will likely be posted too for Sat/Sun. Hope you can join for some or all!<br>
