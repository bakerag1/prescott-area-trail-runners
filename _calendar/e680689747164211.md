PLEASE READ THIS DESCRIPTION. <br>
  We will take Trail 384 to Wolf Creek Falls. The falls are epic right now!! Plan to meet at the first road closure sign (less than a quarter mile from the trail head) at 5&#58;30pm. Drive up Senator, right on Wolf Creek Rd, across from Pine Summit Camp entrance. No drop run (we stop for everyone at every intersection). Bring a headlamp!<br>
  Pin for parking&#58; [http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Parking+location@34.456614,-112.446492<br>
