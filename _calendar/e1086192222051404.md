It’s the 8th annual Whiskey Basin Trail Runs! <br>
  <br>
  Join us on April 15th in gorgeous Prescott for a point to point 91k, the “original” courses for the 60k and 33k ( 🎉), a 1/2 Marathon or 10k with all distances finishing at the gorgeous Watson Lake with its spectacular Granite Dell rock formations. All distances are challenging and enjoy miles and miles of the incredible Prescott Circle Trail. <br>
  Make it a weekend! Camp, run, stay and play…there’s something for everyone at Whiskey Basin and the charming town of Prescott with its famous Whiskey Row, eateries and ice cream parlors is just a stone’s throw away! <br>
  This is one spectacular race that you don’t want to miss…we hope to see you this April at Whiskey Basin Trail Runs!<br>
