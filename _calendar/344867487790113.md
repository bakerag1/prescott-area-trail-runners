description: Please note that we are starting 15 minutes later for the longer drive. We will also be running as only one group as there is no beginner route colocated with the one we are doing. The route is a 6 mile loop which consists of&#58; two miles of steep climb followed by two miles in a sweet canyon and then two miles of fairly steep downhill. This is a no-drop format so we will wait at every intersection for the back of the packers. To find the starting point drive towards Jerome on Highway 89A. Immediately after mile marker 333 you will see an elevation sign of 6000 feet and the road will make a sharp left turn. The parking are is just off of the right side of 89A and everyone needs to park close in order to have parking for everyone. There is additional parking just up the road from the trailhead. Please use caution as you cross 89A as it is a busy road. My cell number is (928) 710-4096 if anyone has questions. <br>
