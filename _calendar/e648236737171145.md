starting at: 2023-07-18 17:30<br>until: 2023-07-18 20:30<br><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/648236737171145/">more info on FB</a><br><br>All are welcome. No drop group run (we stop at every intersection). Mostly rolling single track with an epic view. Cooler than running in Prescott right now! <br>

  ***You may want to plan additional driving time as this is further out. <br>
