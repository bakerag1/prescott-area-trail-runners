description: PLEASE READ THIS DESCRIPTION. <br>
  We will meet at the White Spar Parking lot (link here https&#58;//goo.gl/maps/nX4JGH75u4T7R15g7) at 5&#58;30pm. Beginner group can expect 4 miles and the intermediate + group can expect 6 miles. No drop run (we stop for everyone at every intersection).<br>
  <br>
  Be careful, this is NOT the usual white ROCK parking lot, this is white SPAR. <br>
