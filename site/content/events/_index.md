## Recurring Runs
  * **Tuesdays: 5:30 pm** we have a group run at a trail in the area, usually within a 20 minute drive of downtown Prescott. A 4-6 mile no-drop run, which means we stop at every intersection and wait for everyone.
  * **Wednesdays: 6am** when it’s hot, 7am when it’s not, the Vert Club does laps on Thumb Butte</li>
  * **Thursdays: 5:30pm** at [Fleet Feet](https://www.fleetfeet.com/s/prescott/), Social Run run or walk your own pace and distance, maybe hang out after.
  * **Saturdays: 7:30am** SATR PATR no-drop trail run, at various locations, usually around 8 miles.
