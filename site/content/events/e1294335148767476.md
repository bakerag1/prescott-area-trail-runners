  Join us for the last training ru  n leading up to the Mingus Madne  ss 50k.  This will be an out and   back run of the entire Woodchut  e 102 trail, down to where it en  ds at Forest Road 318A (where th  e second aid station is).  This   is a rough trail, so being able   to scout it ahead of time should   be very valuable!  We'll also b  e hitting my off trail "secret s  pot" on the mountain before maki  ng the big descent, which is als  o part of the course.  Expect 13   miles and about 3,300' of climb  ing and descending.\n\nhttps://w  ww.facebook.com/events/129433514  8767476/
