PLEASE READ THIS DESCRIPTION. <br>
  <br>
  This is a new trail recently created! Jim is one of the volunteers who works on creating trails and will be taking us for a run on some of the new additions near the Peavine trail! <br>
  <br>
  The run will be to the new Splash Trail. We will meet at the Peavine trailhead and run out 1.5 miles to the  Easter Island trail. After a quarter mile up hill, we will turn on the splash trail which is about .9 miles, the last third up hill. (I plan on taking a half mile detour on a new trail that we are still working on off the Splash trail.) Once at the top of the splash trail, we have about a mile, mostly down hill back to the Peavine trail, and then a mile on the Peavine back to the parking lot. About 5 miles total, but a good variety of up and down hill. <br>
  <br>
   No drop run (we stop for everyone at every intersection). <br>
  <br>
  We will meet here at the Peavine trailhead by the Humane Society&#58; [https://g.co/kgs/AFHtnxk<br>
](https://g.co/kgs/AFHtnxk<br>
)  <br>
  Jim is leading! (Thank you Jim!) <br>
  <br>
  Expect 4-6 miles.<br>
