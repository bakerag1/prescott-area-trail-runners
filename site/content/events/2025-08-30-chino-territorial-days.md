The Territorial Days 10k, 5k, & 2 Mile Fun Run / Walk is a fundraiser for the Chino Valley High School Cross Country team. All entrants will receive a t-shirt and there will be awards for entrants who finish in the top 3 in their age group. There WILL be aid stations AND an award ceremony. 

The 10k will start at 7:15am. The 2 mile will start at 7:20am. 

We are also going to do a Virtual race. There is a 5k  distance available. Shirts will be mailed out after results are tabulated. Send your results via link or screenshot from Strava or any other running app to mmetz@chinovalleyschools.com.

If you want to make a donation to the Chino Valley Cross Country team and not run, you may do so.

We are new at a virtual race, so please be patient and email if you have any questions. Thank you!
