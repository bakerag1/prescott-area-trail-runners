  This loop is a bit of a drive but its one of the best in the area! From rocks and desert to pines and forest -this loop has it all! The first two miles involve a lot of elevation gain (expect 1000 ft) followed by two miles of rolling hills and 2 miles of downhill with an epic view! If you survive the first two miles you will agree its all worth it by the end &#58;) <br>
