  20 mile loop around the base of   Granite Mountain with roughly 2,  000’ of elevation change.  Not  hing crazy steep as far as climb  ing, but some of these trails ar  e a little overgrown since they   don’t get used very much.  Thi  s will be a “get it done” pa  ce- I’m expecting it to take a   little under 5 hours.  Meet at   the Williamson Valley trailhead   at 7am.  Come join us!\n\nhttps:  //www.facebook.com/events/217400  3293111644/
