I have 25 miles to do this Saturday and would love some company for all or part of it. <br>

  The route will be determined based on who shows up, but typically I do shorter loops and use my car as an aid station. Loops will likely be a distance somewhere between 8 and 12 miles, with opportunities for out and back. <br>
  <br>
  Meet at White Rock trailhead promptly around 7 am for the first loop!<br>
  <br>
  Any pace is welcome! <br>
