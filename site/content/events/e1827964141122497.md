  We’ll meet at the pullout on 8  9A for the regular Yaeger Canyon   loop, but our route will be a l  ittle bit different.  Expect 11-  12 miles with a little over 2,00  0’ of climbing.  We’ll make   our way up to Mingus Camp just p  ast the lake, and then go to 2 o  f my favorite spots on the mount  ain- the hang gliding launch sit  e and the Mingus fire tower, bef  ore looping back down the mounta  in via the Gaddes Canyon and Lit  tle Yaeger Canyon trails.  I’m   expecting this to take 3 to 3-1  /2 hours, depending on how much   time we stop.  Bring your climbi  ng legs for this one!\n\nhttps:/  /www.facebook.com/events/1827964  141122497/
