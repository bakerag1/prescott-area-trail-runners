  This trail is an out and back, and a great option if you want to join a group run and do a shorter distance. Those looking for longer distances can continue ahead to the junction and do a total of 7 miles. <br>
  <br>
  The parkling lot won't close until dark - so go ahead and park in the trailhead parking. <br>
