Join us for the first of three training runs leading up to the Mingus Madness 50k!  All three runs will start at the Woodchute 102 trailhead at the top of Mingus Mountain.  For the first run, we'll be doing an out and back down Coyote Canyon to the first aid station.  This is where the old cabin and chimney are, and it's a really cool spot at the bottom of the mountain!  Expect about 7.5 miles and 1,500-1,600' of elevation change.<br>
