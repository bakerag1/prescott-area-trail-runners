We will meet at the dirt road that leads up to Quartz Mtn off of White Spar. This is a no-drop group run (we stop at every intersection and allow everyone to catch up before continuing). Expect 5ish miles. We will follow the dirt road up to the trail and jump on the trail up to the mountain and back down. Amazing views of Prescott from the top! <br>
