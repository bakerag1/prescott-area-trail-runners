Welcome to the Madness! Presented by Jason Baum. This is a grassroots, unofficial, non-permitted, minimally supported adventure through some beautiful trails atop and around the Woodchute side of Mingus Mountain. This is a very challenging 50k with rugged and remote trails- expect about 32 miles and 6,000' of vert. Please don't sign up with the expectation of being pampered throughout the race. You'll probably be doing more hiking than running.

The course will be the same as last year, and we are planning on having the same 3 aid stations as last year as well as some post race food (bring your own chairs/blankets- last year it was chilly!). There will be a strict cutoff this year before the descent down the 102 into the second aid station (roughly mile 14). This is pretty much the only spot to bail without committing to running the entire course, so if runners aren't making this descent by 12:30 (5-1/2 hours after the start of the race), they will be asked to take the 102 trail back to the start/finish line, for an 18 mile "fun run". Note that there is no overall cutoff, but you must be starting this descent by 12:30 to continue the race.
