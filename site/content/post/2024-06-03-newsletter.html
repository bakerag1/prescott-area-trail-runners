                        I am going to be doing workouts on the track every Monday for the month of June.  If you are interested in running on the track for some speed work or just some flat miles, I will be there. The best way to get on the track is to park in the back where students usually park and go in the back of the school to the track. Then there are no gates that will be locked. If you have any questions message me. <br>

  <br>
  Well then, plan to join us on June 22nd for the third race in our Insomniac Night Runs Series, Hypnosis Night Runs! <br>
  <br>
  NEW COURSE!!! What? <br>
  <br>
  That’s right, we are once again using the same new, fun course from the 2021 edition! <br>
  <br>
  All runs will be staged out of the main park, at the Coldwater Trailhead. We're excited to introduce this new route, highlighting some of the great trails of Estrella Mountain Park. Experience Butterfield, Gadsen, Coldwater, Dysart, and Rainbow Valley trails depending on your distance. These new routes are flowy and fun! <br>
  <br>
  So pick your poison (50k, 36k, 22k, 15k or 6k) Insomniacs, and plan to party the night away on the trails at Hypnosis Night Runs!<br>

                        Join us in the pines of Flagstaff for our only night race in Northern Arizona at the Blackout Night Runs. This race takes place on the eve of the annual camping extravaganza at the Big Pine Trail Runs. Do both and earn a "double down" medal!<br>
  <br>
  Choose from a 27k, 13k or 6k under a canopy of ponderosa pines and a blanket of stars. These trails are smooth and fabulous for the entire family! <br>

  <br>
  Welcome to the 9th annual Big Pine Trail Runs at Fort Tuthill County Park! <br>
  Runners will get to experience both the Soldiers Trail and Highlands Trail Loop (6 Km runners will only run on a partial Soldiers Trail loop) which winds through the ponderosa pines above 7,000 ft, eventually topping out on a mesa with expansive views of mountain landscapes before being enveloped back into the trees. <br>
  With so much happening in Flagstaff this weekend including Blackout Night Runs the night before and Big Woody Rides on Sunday, the Big Pine weekend is THE best way to kick off your summer. <br>
  Bring the family and we hope to see you there! <br>

                        It’s out there…will YOU be the one to find it this September 7th? <br>
  <br>
  Challenge yourself at one of the toughest and most beautiful races you’ll ever toe the line at. <br>
  <br>
  Join us this fall at the 2024 edition of the Mogollon Monster! <br>
  <br>
  Choose from the point to point 100 mile or get a hefty dose of the Monster in the 42k “Monster Marathon”. No matter which distance you choose, you are sure to appreciate breathtaking climbs up the Rim, exhilarating descents down, spectacular views in between, and possible monster sightings at each turn. <br>
  <br>
  The 42 Km course takes place on Sunday starting at the Pine Trailhead and heads out on the historic Highline Trail to its first rim climb, the Donahue Trail, where runners will join courses with the 100 milers who start 24 hours and 85 miles earlier. The drop off the rim and right back up via West Webber and Turkey Springs will test runners but be sure to soak up the views along the Mogollon Rim. Finishing with a massive vista off the Pine Canyon Trail and miles of gorgeous trail all the way back to the town of Pine where runners will cross under the finish line at the town community center. <br>
  <br>
  This is mountain running at its finest, and you’ll relish every minute of it. <br>
  <br>
  Join us in Pine this September 7-8 for the Mogollon Monster!<br>
