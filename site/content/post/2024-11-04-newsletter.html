                        We are going to check out a newly built trail! This trail goes around Eagle Peak in the dells. Jim assisted with building the new trail and is going to guide the group run on this trail for the first time (Thank you Jim!).<br>
  <br>
  Expect 5.7 miles from the parking lot on 89a, past the Boblett Gravesite, and up around the peak. Miles 1-2 are kind of tough up the hill, but otherwise it's nice rolling hills through some open space and some rocks and canyons. <br>
  <br>
  Here's where we can park (Free) on old hwy 89a&#58; <br>
  34°36'48.4"N 112°25'02.8"W<br>
  (This is where we parked to run to the Boblett Gravesite this summer.)<br>

  This is a no-drop group run so we will stop at every intersection and allow everyone to catch up before continuing on. <br>

                        Join us for the Launch Pad's 6th Annual Christmas City Santa Run, Sponsored by Cambium Wealth & Legacy Strategies, Great Circle Media, and Prescott Woman Magazine on Saturday, December 14, 2024. This 10k, 5k and 1-mile fun run at Brownlow Trail will raise funds to support out of school drop-in and leadership programs at The Launch Pad Teen Center.<br>
  <br>
  Register for the 10k or 5k and receive a Santa Hat, Beard, and commemorative Santa Run ornament (We do encourage you to run in full Santa Gear...you could win a prize), or register yourself or your little one for the Rudolph Run and get a set of antlers and a red nose! There will be a cookie, hot cider and cocoa booth hosted by Foothills Bank at the beginning and end of the race, and a prize of an Ugly Sweater for 1st and 2nd place 10K and 5K runners in both the women's and men's groups.<br>
  <br>
  Things to Know Before Registering&#58;<br>
  The Brownlow Trail is super fun with rolling hills, fun turns, and beautiful scenery, but it would be tough to run with a stroller. If you are thinking of bringing your kiddo(s) in a stroller, come and check out the race course in advance.<br>

  34.541342, -112.437366<br>
  <br>
  Expect 4-6 miles. This is a no-drop group run, so we will stop at every trail intersection and wait for everyone to catch up before continuing the run. (No runners left behind!)<br>
  <br>
  Bring a light &#58;)<br>
  <br>
  Directions&#58;  Take HWY-69 towards Prescott. After leaving the Prescott Valley area, you'll reach the intersection of HWY-69 and HWY-89. Stay left on Gurley street and make a quick left turn onto Robinson Drive into a residential area. From Robinson Drive, turn left on Butterfield Road. When you reach a five way intersection, turn right onto Wells Fargo Road. When Wells Fargo road turns north, look on your right for a small, hidden dirt road (the trailhead sign is tough to spot). Take this well graded dirt road to the parking area and Turley Trailhead.<br>

  Challenge yourself in 2025 and join us for the 12th annual Black Canyon Ultras. The 100k takes place on Saturday and the 50k on Sunday, giving you the unique opportunity to up the ante of epicness and run them both, making it the “Black Canyon Echo Challenge”! <br>
