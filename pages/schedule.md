event details and discussion

*Tuesdays:* 5:30 pm we have a group run at a trail in the area, usually within a
20 minute drive of downtown Prescott. 
There will be 2 groups of runners - beginner (up to 3 miles out and back) and intermediate+ (5-6 miles).
Both groups are no-drop which means we stop at every intersection and wait for everyone

*Thursdays:* March-October 5:30 pm at Soul Ride, we meet on the back patio and go for whatever
kind of run you want, there will be loosely organized groups and individuals running 30 minutes
to an hour, mostly on Granite Creek and connecting trails and roads. Stay for a
beer and conversation afterwards. The first Thursday of each month is pot-luck, we
usually have a bigger crowd and less running. Usually there is a group that does
a core workout an hour prior on the field behind the shop.

*Track Daze* When there's interest, on Mondays we do track workouts at Prescott
High School at 5:30pm when it isn't too hot, 6am when it is.

*Miscellaneous:* Frequently members will plan runs or hikes inviting all comers.
