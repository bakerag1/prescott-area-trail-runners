*Tuesdays:* 5:30 pm we have a group run at a trail in the area, usually within a
20 minute drive of downtown Prescott. This is a no-drop run, we stop and wait at
each intersection, all running abilities are welcome. We typically have two
groups, one doing about 4 miles, and the other 5 to 6 (and a little faster).

*Thursdays:* 5:30 pm at Soul Ride, we meet on the back patio and go for whatever
kind of run you want, there will be loosely organized groups and individuals running 30 minutes
to an hour, mostly on Granite Creek and connecting trails and roads. Stay for a
beer and conversation afterwards. The third Thursday of each month is pot-luck, we
usually have a bigger crowd and less running.
