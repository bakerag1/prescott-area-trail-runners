*Tuesdays:* 5:30 pm we have a group run at a trail in the area, usually within a
20 minute drive of downtown Prescott. 
There will be 2 groups of runners - beginner (up to 3 miles out and back) and intermediate+ (5-6 miles).
Both groups are no-drop which means we stop at every intersection and wait for everyone

*Wednesdays:* Vert Club does laps on Thumb Butte

*Miscellaneous:* Frequently members will plan runs or hikes inviting all comers.
