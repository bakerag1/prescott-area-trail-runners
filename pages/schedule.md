*Tuesdays:* 5:30 pm we have a group run at a trail in the area, usually within a
20 minute drive of downtown Prescott. This is a 5 to 6 mile no-drop run, we stop and wait at
each intersection, all running abilities are welcome. 

*Thursdays:* March-October 5:30 pm at Soul Ride, we meet on the back patio and go for whatever
kind of run you want, there will be loosely organized groups and individuals running 30 minutes
to an hour, mostly on Granite Creek and connecting trails and roads. Stay for a
beer and conversation afterwards. The first Thursday of each month is pot-luck, we
usually have a bigger crowd and less running.

*AARP Run:* Sometimes on Thursday there will be an afternoon run of 8-10 miles,
you don't have to be retired to attend, but it's probably a little early for
working folks.

*Miscellaneous:* Frequently members will plan runs or hikes inviting all comers.
